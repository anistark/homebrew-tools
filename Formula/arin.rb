# Homebrew formula for Arin, building from source.
#
# This is the 0.5 and 0.6 install path, and it exists because signing does not yet. A
# downloaded app has to get past Gatekeeper, and getting past Gatekeeper needs a Developer
# ID certificate, which arrives in 0.7. Something compiled on the machine it runs on was
# never downloaded, carries no `com.apple.quarantine` attribute, and Gatekeeper never
# engages. So building from source is not a compromise here: it is the only route that
# installs cleanly before there is a certificate.
#
# Replaced by Casks/arin.rb in 0.7, and this file deleted at the same time. Keeping both
# means one tap answering `brew install` and `brew install --cask` with two different
# builds of the same version, one signed and one not.
#
# Source of truth is packaging/homebrew/arin-formula.rb in anistark/arin. Edit it there.
#
# NOT YET INSTALLABLE. anistark/arin has no tagged release, so there is no source tarball
# to point at and no checksum to verify against. Before merging, set both:
#
#   url     the v0.5.0 tag, once it exists
#   sha256  curl -sL <tarball-url> | shasum -a 256
#
# then confirm with `brew audit --strict --online anistark/tools/arin`, which fetches the
# url and checks the checksum.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Arin is a menu bar app with no Dock icon.

      Start it:

        arin -d

      Or start it at login:

        #{opt_prefix}/Arin.app/Contents/Resources/launch-agent.sh enable #{opt_prefix}/Arin.app

      Grant Screen Recording in System Settings > Privacy & Security when asked.

      This build is unsigned, which has one consequence worth knowing: macOS ties the
      Screen Recording grant to the exact binary, so upgrading Arin will ask for the
      permission again. A signed build, from 0.7, keeps it across upgrades.

      The app lives in the Homebrew prefix rather than /Applications, so Spotlight will not
      find it. That also arrives with the signed build, which ships as a cask.
